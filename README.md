A data driven model using RL to solve a traffic simulation optimization problem to minimize carsâ€™ carbon emissions. 

# Introduction
This repository implements an intelligent agent that minimizes the waiting times of cars over a traffic intersection.
We are using a microscopic artificial simulation of the traffic named SUMO, which closely mimics real-life scenarios.
The agent obtains information regarding the current state of the simulation from the environment and provides decisions based on the provided state.
